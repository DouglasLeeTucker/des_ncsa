        <p>DR1 is composed of data taken during 345 nights spread over the first three years of DES operations from 2013 August 15 to 2016 February 12.<br/>In this section, we briefly describe the characteristics of the DECam instrument and the DES observation strategy to provide context for DR1.<br/>We point the reader to other DES publications for further details on the technical aspects summarized here (i.e. Diehl et al. 2014, <a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2015AJ....150..150F">Flaugher et al. 2015</a>,<a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017arXiv170801531D"> Drlica-Wagner et al. 2017</a>, Morganson et al. 2018).</p>
        <h3>DECam</h3>
        <p>DECam is a wide field-of-view (3 sq. deg.) mosaic camera composed of 62 science CCDs (<a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2015AJ....150..150F">Flaugher et al. 2015</a>).<br/>The corrector system and pixel size provide an average plate scale of 0.263 arcsec per pixel.<br/>The DES wide-area survey observes five broadband filters, g, r, i, z, Y (see figure below), and the standard bandpasses for these filters are included as part of DR1.<br/>The DES filters are very similar to their analogously-named counterparts from other surveys. Uniquely, the DES z band has greater sensitivity at longer wavelengths than the SDSS z band and overlaps with the DES Y band.Additional details, including construction, installation, and a description of DECam subsystems and interfaces are provided in  (<a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2015AJ....150..150F">Flaugher et al. 2015</a>).</p>
