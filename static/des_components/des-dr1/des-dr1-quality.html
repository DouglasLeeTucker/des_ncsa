        <p>In this section, we provide a general assessment of the DR1 data quality including astrometric and photometric precision, imaging depth in terms of measurement signal-to-noise and object detection completeness, morphological object classification accuracy, and the identification and removal of likely artifacts.</p>
        <h3>Astrometry</h3>
        <p>The DR1 astrometric solution is derived in two steps using SCAMP with 2MASS as the reference catalog (Morganson et al. 2018). At the single-epoch stage, we find internal astrometric uncertainties of 42, 36, 37, 39, and 56 mas in the g, r, i, z, and Y bands, respectively, as determined from the median of two-dimensional angular separations between repeated measurements of bright stars from individual exposures. Following the astrometric refinement step for image coaddition by SCAMP, the estimated internal astrometric precision for the coadd is ~30mas RMS (median over coadd tiles). The absolute astrometric uncertainty of the coadd is evaluated with respect to Gaia DR1 (<a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2016A%26A...595A...2G">Gaia Collaboration et al. 2016</a>). Figure 6 shows that the residuals are smallest in regions with with larger stellar densities closer to the Galactic plane (for comparison, see Figure 13), and the mean over the footprint is ~145 mas. Further details of astrometric calibration, including ongoing development using Gaia as a reference catalog, are provided in <a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017PASP..129g4503B">Bernstein et al. (2017b</a>).</p>
        <h3>Photometry</h3>
        <p>The relative top-of-the-atmosphere flux measurements for astronomical sources in DR1 have been calibrated using a forward modeling technique to account for both atmospheric and instrumental components of the total system throughput (FGCM; <a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017arXiv170601542B">Burke et al. 2017</a>). The parameters of the model were initially fit from observations taken in photometric conditions to establish a network of calibration stars that spans the full survey footprint. This network was subsequently used to refine the calibration of exposures taken in non-photometric conditions. Meanwhile, the absolute photometric calibration of DR1 is tied to the spectrophotometric Hubble CALSPEC standard star C26202 (<a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2014PASP..126..711B">Bohlin et al. 2014</a>) located in the SN field C3.<br/>Several hundred repeated measurements of C26202 in a variety of conditions yielded a set of small shifts (3 mmag) to place the DES photometry on the AB system. These shifts have been pre-applied to the DR1 zeropoints. The statistical uncertainties on these shifts are estimated to be 2.6, 2.9, 3.4, 2.5, and 4.5 mmag for the g, r, i, z, and Y bands, respectively. Additional sources of systematic uncertainty on the absolute photometric calibration could arise from uncertainty in the level of out-of-band light leakage and uncertainty in the synthetic photometry of C26202. We are currently undertaking observations and analysis of two additional HST CALSPEC standards to reduce the systematic uncertainty of the AB offsets.  We reproduce below several of the key results from <a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017arXiv170601542B">Burke et al. (2017)</a> regarding the relative photometric calibration.</p>
        <p>The single-epoch photometric statistical precision (associated with random errors in the FGCM fit parameters) derived from repeated measurements of FGCM calibration stars is 7.3, 6.1, 5.9, 7.3, 7.8 mmag in the g, r, i, z, and Y bands, respectively. Under the assumption that successive tiled observations of the same fields yield largely independent model fit parameters (as would be expected from the widely spaced observations in DES), we estimate the statistical precision of coadd zeropoints by combining the fit results from overlapping exposures. The median coadd zeropoint statistical uncertainty for the g, r, i, z, and Y band is 5, 4, 5, 6, and 5 mmag, respectively. Figure 7 shows an example distribution for the i band. As a validation, we compare the photometric uniformity of DES DR1 to the space-based Gaia G-ban photometry. Variations in uniformity are found to be 6.6 mmag, as estimated from a Gaussian fit to the offset distribution between G<sub>Gaia</sub> and G<sub>pred</sub>(r) predicted from the DES r-band.</p>
        <p>To account for extinction from interstellar dust, we include an additional column in the DR1 photometry tables for E(B - V) values from the reddening map of <a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1998ApJ...500..525S">Schlegel et al. (1998)</a> (SFD98) at the location of each catalog object. The E(B -V) values were obtained using a linear interpolation of the Zenithal Equal Area projected map distributed by SFD98. We computed fiducial interstellar extinction coefficients, R<sub>b</sub>, for each band so that the corrections to the FGCM calibrated source magnitudes are A<sub>b</sub> = E(B -V)R<sub>b</sub>. Fiducial coefficients are derived using the <a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1999PASP..111...63F">Fitzpatrick (1999)</a> reddening law with R<sub>V</sub> = 3.1 and the <a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2011ApJ...737..103S">Schlafly &amp; Finkbeiner (2011)</a> calibration adjustment to the original SFD98 reddening map (N = 0.78). Note that the <a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2011ApJ...737..103S" > Schlafly &amp; Finkbeiner (2011)</a> calibration adjustment is included in our fiducial reddening coefficients; these coefficients are intended to be used directly with E(B -V) values from the original SFD98 reddening map. We integrated over the DR1 Standard Bandpasses considering a fixed source spectrum that is constant in spectral flux density per unit wavelength, and adopted the low-extinction limit. The latter simplification is appropriate for DES, for which E(B-V) &lt; 0.1 mag over ~99% of the footprint. The resulting multiplicative coefficients for each band, R<sub>b</sub>, are 3.186, 2.140, 1.569, 1.196 and 1.048 in the g, r, i, z and Y bands, respectively. The DES science team continues to explore systematic uncertainties associated with interstellar extinction modeling.</p>
        <h3>Flagged objects</h3>
        <p>The single-epoch object catalogs include a binary flag parameter, IMAFLAGS_ISO, that expresses the union of all mask bits present for pixels within the isophotal radius of each source (Morganson et al. 2018). For coadd objects, if any pixel is masked in all of the contributing exposures for a given band, the IMAFLAGS_ISO = 1 flag is set for that band. This flag is predominantly set for saturated objects and objects with missing data. We recommend a baseline quality criteria of IMAFLAGS_ISO = 0 (in the relevant bands) for most science applications since the majority of flagged objects have unreliable photometry. The DES DR1 catalog also includes other standard flags FLAGS provided by the SExtractor pipeline.</p>
        <h3>Depth</h3>
        <p>The effective depth of the DES DR1 wide-field coadd catalog is dependent on the photometric measurement of interest and can be quantified through various approaches. Here we derive simple depth estimates from the flux distribution of cataloged objects, the magnitude corresponding to a fixed signal-to-noise threshold (S/N = 10), an aperture estimate from the input imaging, and object detection completeness. In general, the type of source and surface brightness must also be considered when evaluating the survey depth. The settings used for the source extraction and deblending steps of the DESDM pipeline allow for efficient detection of objects with S/N  ~10 in the <em>r +i+z</em> composite detection image (Morganson et al. 2018). At the bright end, saturation  effects start to become important at r &lt; 16. For even brighter magnitudes, the fraction of saturated objects increases until objects are no longer cataloged due to pixel-level masking applied during processing. For each of the depth studies considered here, we selected a sample of high-quality DR1 coadd objects with using FLAGS_[GRIZ] &lt; 4 and IMAFLAGS_ISO_[GRIZ] = 0. Below we describe these different approaches to estimate the depth of DR1. </p>
